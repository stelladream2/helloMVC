// README.md

This is the README file for the MVC project by integrating JSP and Servlet.  
MVC is a design pattern that separates the model, view and controller.  
This source shows MVC architecture by integrating servlets and jsps.    
I hope that you understand MVC design pattern.
I joined this project.
I will upload more useful source.
Thanks from nykim
